custom comparator function 

bool sorting(pair<int,int>a, pair<int,int>b){
    if(a.second==b.second){
        return a.first>b.first;
    }
    return a.second<b.second;
}

sort(vec.begin(),vec.end(),sorting);


---------------------------------------------------------------
here the a is the first number and b is the next one like we do in normal sorting the a[i] and a[j] and swap them according to the conditions
so in the comparator function write the conditions as you want them to be in your array 
as:- if you want the first number a to be less than b then write return a<b
what this will do is if a<b is true then it will leave it as it is 
but if a<b is false then it will swap the numbers
